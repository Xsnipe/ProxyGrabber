# Proxy Grabber

Proxy Grabber is a WPF application that uses multiple free proxy API's in order to obtain HTTPS, HTTP, socks4, and socks5 proxies.

## How to use

Open up ProxyGrabber.exe or run the .sln file in visual studio and run the debugger. Once the white window pops up hit the start button.

**Heads up:** If the window freezes or is unresponsive **wait,**
 the window will unfreeze and the proxies will show in the text box.
